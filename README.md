My message to the world is that love is the key that unlocks us to our fullest potential. We can accept the universe as one shared existence, this way no one would miss treat another as it would be like miss treating oneself. We can unify through love and acceptance, as we learn to view the world through the eyes of non-domination. We can consider our relationships with one another, and not only with people but with minerals, plants, animals and the entire cosmos as we are all relative to each other. We can heal each other with our Toroidal energy fields/Magnanimous auras when we love."Therefore you will know the Torus and the Torus will set you free. " - Santos Bonacci</p>
